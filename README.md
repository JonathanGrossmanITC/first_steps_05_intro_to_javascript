# JavaScript Intro  

Welcome to the fifth lesson! In this lesson, you review the HTML and CSS quiz and start learning JavaScript. You will briefly review the quiz questions and answers to reinforce what you learned in the first four lessons. Then, you begin learning about JavaScript.

JavaScript is a programming language used in web developemt. Among the things you can do with JavaScript are write frontend web applications and build servers. In this First Steps program, you learn how to write frontend web pages in JavaScript. In the [ITC Fullstack Program](https://www.itc.tech), students learn more advanced frontend JavaScript techniques, how to build JavaScript frontend we applications using JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and how to write servers in JavaScript.

After learning in this lesson about what JavaScript is, you learn about the different data types in JavaScript. Data types are the format in which data is saved in memory. For instance, JavaScript has data type for strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and more. You need to know what the data types are and when and how to work with them.

Throughout the lesson, you will see examples that demonstrate some of the JavaScript basics and will learn about resources that can guide you through the learning process.
